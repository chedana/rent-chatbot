A full set of Miele appliances are neatly integrated throughout, while the patinated-brass Quooker tap coordinates with brass sockets and ironmongery. Recessed lights and wall sconces cast a warm glow come evening, creating an ambient feel for the dining nook and bespoke banquette seating. Keeping things neatly streamlined, there’s a separate laundry room. <PARA> The principal bedroom suite is a study in contemporary refinement. Bespoke open shelving stretches along one wall, while natural light streams through black-framed windows.
