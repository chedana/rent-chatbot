Originally a ransom strip of land connecting the street to a now-demolished building behind, the house was built circa 1930 and later refurbished in the 1950s. More recently, it has been thoughtfully cared for and refined, resulting in a home that feels both characterful and highly considered. <PARA> For such a compact footprint, there is an impressive amount to unpack. Every square foot across the three floors has been carefully designed to maximise space, light and functionality. <PARA> Even at just seven feet wide, the house has a striking presence within Peel Street’s historic terrace. A passion for the Arts and Crafts era is evident throughout, with decorative detailing extending to the façade: a zinc-canopied entrance, curved window cover and a custom dragon’s-head downpipe — a symbolic nod to the movement. Inside, beautifully patinated parquet flooring runs through the ground-floor kitchen, entered via an ornate stained-glass front door. <PARA> The ground floor immediately surprises. Ceiling heights and proportions lend a Tardis-like quality to the open-plan kitchen and dining space — equally suited to relaxed dinners with friends or quiet mornings with coffee. <PARA> Between this space and one of the two bedrooms sits an ingeniously arranged shower room and WC. The bedroom itself continues the Arts and Crafts theme, paired with industrial-style solid wood flooring. Glazed double doors lead to a small light well, offering a sliver of private outdoor space. <PARA> The first-floor reception room is rich with period character. An elegant decorative fireplace forms the focal point, complemented by exposed floorboards. At the rear, glazed doors open onto a generous decked terrace with ornate balustrading — a wonderfully private spot for alfresco dining or evening drinks in warmer months. <PARA> A final flight of warm wooden stairs leads to the top-floor suite. Here, a front-facing sash window sits within a half-eaved wall, while a notably spacious en-suite bathroom completes the internal accommodation. <PARA> In the Neighbourhood <PARA> Notting Hill Gate and the wider Kensington neighbourhood are defined by their access to green space, with both Kensington Gardens and Holland Park just a short walk away. <PARA> Peel Street itself offers an appealing village-like feel, quietly tucked away from the wider pace of London. Nearby Kensington Church Street provides an excellent selection of boutiques, cafés, restaurants and bars, making this an ideal base from which to enjoy the city. <PARA> Transport & Connections <PARA> Notting Hill Gate station (Central Line) is within easy walking distance, while High Street Kensington offers District and Circle Line connections, providing excellent access across London. <PARA> Material Information <PARA> • Property construction: Traditional brick <PARA> • Heating type: Electric heaters <PARA> • Utilities: Electricity, Water & Broadband <PARA> • Electricity supply: Independently supplied by EDF Energy <PARA> • Water supply & Sewerage: Mains connected via Thames Water <PARA> • Broadband: Standard download speed 16Mbps, Upload speed 1Mbps.Ultrafast available (d/s & u/s 1000Mbps).
