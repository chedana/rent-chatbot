Here they’d record demos for two of their tracks ‘Anarchy in the UK’ and ‘Pretty Vacant’. <PARA> Set back and with its own private courtyard, this Signature Apartment allows guests to sleep in a little piece of history. A duplex mews house, it is the epitome of punk prowess and versatility, complete with tartan and sheer roman blinds along with statement upholstered graffitied chairs. <PARA> In true punk rock spirit, the apartment has been reimagined with the living space upstairs where Johnny Rotten’s storied caricatures comfortably reside. Complete with kitchenette maxi-bar, bold furniture designs pay direct homage to the building's history, while the bedroom downstairs features a black Murphy bed, flanked by marbled moulin noir bedsides. In addition, a brazen reimagining of vintage chairs – modernised for both their time and this place. Wrapping almost the entire room, the hand drawn caricatures by John Lydon, aka Johnny Rotten, led to the building being upgraded from Grade II to the prestigious Grade II* listed status by Historic England. This, somewhat rightly, conveniently coincided with Punk’s 40th Anniversary as they were deemed as important an archeological find as prehistoric cave paintings. In addition to all of the original architectural details there's also a replica of Steve Jones' Les Paul hanging all the wall. <PARA> While a 65-inch screen complements the sound system, courtesy of world-respected audio manufacturers Void and Artcoustic, touching the imagination of similar spirited music lovers.
